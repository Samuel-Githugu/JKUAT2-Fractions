This was my second coding assignment during my one year stint studying Computer Science (BSc.) at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. 
The code is meant to perform basic mathematical functions (addition, subtraction, mutliplication and division) on 2 fractions input by the user in the format x,y for x/y.
The code is written entirely in C.
